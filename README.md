# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

General logic to the code:

1. Code reads the file from URL and downloads the file
2. "Activity", "Subject" and "Features" are read seperately and saved in different datasets
3. To form one tidy data set, rbind and cbind functions are used to bind all the data into one dataset
4. From the main data set, a subset data was created that captures only the mean and standard deviation
